## ALLIANCE FOR DOWNTOWN NEW YORK

Create a central meeting place for the creative and tech community in Lower Manhattan.

### Background

The Alliance for Downtown New York wanted to attract more creative and tech companies to Lower Manhattan. During our research, we noticed that Lower Manhattan was missing its "Ace Hotel" -- a central place for the community to convene.

### Approach

We decided to re-imagined The Hive at 55, a co-working space, to become the "Living Room" for the creative and tech community in Lower Manhattan. The new Lower Manhattan HQ will include 12,500 sq ft of space designed to inspire collaboration, community, and creativity, and be organized by:

* Living Room: Members can come and plug-in, host meetings and spontaneously meet interesting people with an awesome coffee bar.
* Event Space: Programming that brings the community together.
* Brainstorming Rooms: Members can work from spaces that have been specifically designed and integrated with the latest technology to inspire creativity.

### Activated Through Sponsorships

We also helped the Alliance for Downtown New York secure the right partners like Microsoft, IdeaPaint and NY Tech Meetup to activate the space through products and programming.
