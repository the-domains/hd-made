## FOX SPORTS: JUST A BIT OUTSIDE

Design a new site for the most passionate baseball fans.

### 

### Approach

To express that passion and authenticity, we knew our art direction should be steeped in the traditional aesthetics of baseball's storied lineage. We scoured memorabilia and junk shops, digging up rare vintage uniforms and Brooklyn Dodgers banners that hadn't been hung since 1955\. We poured over decades of baseball cards and team ephemera. More than mere nostalgia, we were targeting the core emotional connection that bonds true fans --- typically from childhood --- to America's pastime.

### 

### 

### Logo Exploration

The fan's experience of the game was at the center of our approach to design and is evident across the site: strong, smooth lettering like what is found on the road greys for so many teams; fine, sharp lines that bring to mind reading the standings in the newspaper; background texture on the homepage that mimics a sun-bleached scorecard; and a menu icon that is reminiscent of stitching on a baseball.

### 

### 

### Mobile Reading Experience

We then translated the visual identity to a mobile-first reading experience. We wanted each article to stand out and let fans get to the stories as easily as possible.
